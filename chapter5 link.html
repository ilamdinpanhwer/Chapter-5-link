        <p>To actually use the computer, you <sup>’</sup> ll need to connect a mouse and keyboard. The vast majority of recent keyboards and mice use a <br> USB connection, making it simple to find a usable port. <br>Simply plug your mouse and keyboard, or their adapter(s) if they are wireless, into any available USB ports and they will be ready to go. <br> If you are using an older keyboard and mouse setup, you will need to connect them using the green and purple PS/2 ports shown in the <br> chart above. Luckily, these cables are color-coded at the ends; simply match up the color with its corresponding port and you <sup>'</sup> ll be on <br> your way to using your new computer. </p>

         <p>If you <sup>’</sup> ve purchased a refurbished or pre-configured machine, chances are you will not have to go through the first-time setup and it will <br> boot straight to the desktop. In that case, skip to the next section. <br>
            If you see a welcome or setup screen upon booting your machine, you <sup>’</sup> ll be taken through a first-time setup. This will be a fairly simple <br> process that will ask you to set your preferred language, time zone, and other basic questions to customize your user experience. <br>            
            Follow the onscreen instructions and you <sup>’</sup> ll eventually be booted to the desktop where our real work begins.</p>

             <p>For desktops connected directly to a router using an Ethernet cable, you’ll be automatically connected to your network and generally won’t need to take any <br> further steps. For laptops and desktops utilizing wireless cards for WiFi capability, you’ll need to connect to your chosen network. <br> The first-time setup if present will help you through this process, but if you are booted straight to the desktop or need to add additional networks, follow this <br> guide. <br> First, ensure you know any needed credentials, such as if you have a network password setup to prevent others from using your WiFi or connecting to your <br> network without authorization. Also, make sure you know the name of the network you’ll be connecting to. Often this will be displayed on your router itself, or <br> you named it yourself during the setup of your home internet network. <br> Navigate to Network Connections/Network and Sharing Center, either using the Control Panel via the Start Menu or by typing “network” into the Start Menu <br> search bar. <br> Click or right-click on the desired network and hit “connect”, the computer will work to connect you to the network wirelessly and may ask you to enter in the <br> password if there is one set up. <br> Alternatively, you may also see a Wi-Fi signal icon in the Windows taskbar in the lower right-hand corner of your desktop where the time and date are located. <br> This icon will also take you to the internet options you need to get set up. <br> If you simply can’t get connected to the network or the PC tells you your password is incorrect, call your internet service provider and they will help you get <br> connected correctly. <br> </p>

             <p>If your computer is brand new, there will be a number of Windows Updates needed to get it up to the latest version. Even with a refurbished machine, it is good <br> practice to check for any new updates that may have come out since the computer was last worked on. <br> Navigate to the Windows Update screen by either typing “Windows Update” into the Start Menu search bar, or using the Control Panel.</p>
